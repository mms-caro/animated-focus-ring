<h1>Animated focus ring</h1>
<p>
  This page builds upon the
  <a href="#">WICG <code>:focus-ring</code> polyfill</a>
  by adding support for animating the focus ring as it
  moves around the page via a simple drop-in script.
</p>
<p>
  The behavior is based on the behavior of the focus
  ring on the <a href="http://webaim.org/">WebAIM</a> website.
</p>
<p>
  This can be useful for keyboard users who might have a
  difficult time seeing where their focus ring has moved to
  when they press tab, which can be particularly hard if
  focusable elements on the page are spaced far apart.
</p>
<h2>Example focusable inputs</h2>
<button type="button">Here is a button</button>
<label for="text-field">Here is a text field</label>
<input type="text" id="text-field">
<script src="vendor/focus-ring.js"></script>
<script src="animated-focus-ring.js"></script>
